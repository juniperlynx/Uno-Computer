This is a very simple assembler for the Uno computer. There is no support for
macros or other extensions. As there is not yet a programmer for the Uno
computer the primary use case is to output binary text in a format that can be
easily toggled into the machine manually. It is written in python and can be
ran as:

python unoasm.py <inputfile>

Or:

python unoasm.py <inputfile> -o <outputfile>

When ran without an output file name the output will go to stdout
